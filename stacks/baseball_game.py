# You are keeping the scores for a baseball game with strange rules. At the beginning of the game, you start with an empty record.
# You are given a list of strings operations, where operations[i] is the ith operation you must apply to the record and is one of the following:

# An integer x.
# Record a new score of x.
# '+'.
# Record a new score that is the sum of the previous two scores.
# 'D'.
# Record a new score that is the double of the previous score.
# 'C'.
# Invalidate the previous score, removing it from the record.
# Return the sum of all the scores on the record after applying all the operations.
# The test cases are generated such that the answer and all intermediate calculations fit in a 32-bit integer and that all operations are valid.

Example 1:
Input: ops = ["5","2","C","D","+"]
Output: 30
Explanation:
"5" - Add 5 to the record, record is now [5].
"2" - Add 2 to the record, record is now [5, 2].
"C" - Invalidate and remove the previous score, record is now [5].
"D" - Add 2 * 5 = 10 to the record, record is now [5, 10].
"+" - Add 5 + 10 = 15 to the record, record is now [5, 10, 15].
The total sum is 5 + 10 + 15 = 30.

Example 2:
Input: ops = ["5","-2","4","C","D","9","+","+"]
Output: 27
Explanation:
"5" - Add 5 to the record, record is now [5].
"-2" - Add -2 to the record, record is now [5, -2].
"4" - Add 4 to the record, record is now [5, -2, 4].
"C" - Invalidate and remove the previous score, record is now [5, -2].
"D" - Add 2 * -2 = -4 to the record, record is now [5, -2, -4].
"9" - Add 9 to the record, record is now [5, -2, -4, 9].
"+" - Add -4 + 9 = 5 to the record, record is now [5, -2, -4, 9, 5].
"+" - Add 9 + 5 = 14 to the record, record is now [5, -2, -4, 9, 5, 14].
The total sum is 5 + -2 + -4 + 9 + 5 + 14 = 27.

Example 3:
Input: ops = ["1","C"]
Output: 0
Explanation:
"1" - Add 1 to the record, record is now [1].
"C" - Invalidate and remove the previous score, record is now [].
Since the record is empty, the total sum is 0.
