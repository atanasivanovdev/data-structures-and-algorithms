## Overview

The purpose of this repository is to practice and improve my understanding of essential data structures and algorithms. Each folder in this repository contains solutions for problems related to a specific data structure or algorithm category. Solutions include explanations and optimised implementations.

## Directory Structure

- **algorithms**: Common algorithms with explanations and problem solutions.
- **arrays**: Array manipulation, sliding window problems, and prefix sums.
- **graphs**: Graph traversal, shortest path, and connectivity algorithms.
- **hash_tables**: Implementations of hash tables and common hashing problems.
- **linked_lists**: Linked list operations, such as reversal and node removal.
- **math**: Math-related problems, including integer reversal and calculations.
- **performance_testing**: Performance tests and benchmarks for optimized algorithms.
- **pointers**: Two-pointer and fast-and-slow pointer problems.
- **queues**: Queue implementations and queue-based problems.
- **resources**: Useful cheat sheets and resources for quick reference.
- **sliding_window**: Sliding window technique for various array problems.
- **stacks**: Stack operations and common stack-based problem solutions.
- **trees**: Binary trees, binary search trees, and traversal algorithms.
